# **EX01 — Polynomial Operations Project**

## Project Overview
This project is Assignment 1 in the **Introduction to Computation** course, taught during Semester A in the **Faculty of Computer Science, Ariel University**.

The goal of the project is to **implement and analyze functions that operate on polynomial equations**, including arithmetic operations, derivative calculations, intersections, and more.

## Main Features

- **Polynomial Addition**  
  Constructing a polynomial that represents the sum of two given polynomials.

- **Polynomial Multiplication**  
  Constructing a polynomial that represents the product of two given polynomials.

- **Derivative Calculation**  
  Computing the derivative of a polynomial.

- **Intersection Points**  
  Finding the intersection points between two distinct polynomials.

- **Distance Calculation**  
  Computing the distance between two points on a polynomial.

- **Area Between Polynomials**  
  Calculating the enclosed area between two polynomials.

- **Polynomial String Conversion**  
  Converting a polynomial from an array representation to a string and vice versa,  
  where each index in the array corresponds to the power of *x*, and the value at that index is the coefficient.

## Testing

- Each function in the project has at least one dedicated test case.
- A total of **35 unit tests** were written using **JUnit 5** to ensure correctness and reliability.
