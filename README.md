Project Overview
This project constitutes Assignment 1 in the Introduction to Computation course, offered during Semester A at the Faculty of Computer Science, Ariel University.
The primary objective of the project is to implement and analyze functions that operate on polynomial equations. The tasks include:
*Constructing a polynomial representing the sum of two given polynomials
*Constructing a polynomial representing the product of two given polynomials
*Computing the derivative of a polynomial
*Determining the intersection points between two distinct polynomials
*Calculating the distance between two points on a polynomial
*Computing the area enclosed between two polynomials
*Converting a polynomial represented as an array into its string representation and vice versa, where each array index corresponds to the power of x and the value at that index represents the coefficient of x.

For each function, there is at least one test function that verifies its correctness, with a total of 35 tests in the project.
